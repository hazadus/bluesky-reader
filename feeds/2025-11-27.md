💬 facet-solver now disambiguates based on key names AND value types!

it passes evil tests: picking between an `u8` and `u16` enum variants, between `DateTime` and `String`...

and it does so very efficiently! only asking for a parse if there's absolutely no other way to resolve the ambiguity.

💬 forget reducing compile times, forget reducing binary sizes. 

right now it's more about reflection is a better basis for serialization and deserialization than the other way around.

💬 The more recent stuff I've been doing (facet-solver) would be completely impossible if all you had to go with were some code. But if you have data structures, if you actually have the shape of your types, you can do so much. You can do diffs, you can do partial distribution, you can do so much.

💬 I think ultimately, even if you don't fully understand the why of reflection, you're going to notice that the experience of using crates that rely on it is just so much nicer.

💬 ...and the more things turn "const" (like type_id comparison) the more things we could do with that type information at compile time. You can already use facet to do code generation in a build script. It's just a little bit awkward right now.

I mean, it's a really vast question, to be honest.

💬 I've been idly dreaming about a JIT demo for facet, which would take care of performance concerns. But really right now I'm focused on all the benefits you get and not the performance costs or how much code is emitted.

Because, obviously, generating exactly the code you need is going to win.

💬 One fun thing that we did with facet.json in the beginning is do iterative serialization instead of recursive, which lets you serialize much, much bigger structs.

💬 But a sibling use case is doing asynchronous streaming, deserialization and serialization. With optional filtering. Again, if you have the type information, you can do that. If all you have is synchronous code, then you're shit out of luck.

💬 first: my newest zine, The Secret Rules of the Terminal! 

This has all the gnarly details about the Unix terminal that I wish I knew when I started using it. It's weird and kind of wonderful (I talk about why you can use your mouse in the terminal!)
