💬 In no particular order: A Link to the Past; Wind Waker; and Breath of the Wild. 

ALttP is the undeniable OG GOAT. WW has the best story and art/animation. And BotW might be an overrated plagiarism of every other AAA sandbox game, but it's still the high point of the series in a lot of respects.

💬 Honorable mentions: 

- Twilight Princess is criminally underrated
- Tears of the Kingdom is more like the world's biggest ever DLC than a game in its own right, but I mostly like its gameplay mechanics better than BotW's.
- Almost all the others are valid answers—except Skyward Sword, which sucks.

💬 Ocarina of Time isn't on my personal list even though I played it to death, just because I think it was a little more time-and-place than most of the others. It hasn't aged as well, and the linear path it put the series on was extremely hit-and-miss. Still: for its time, it was epic.

💬 Oh man I just realized I forgot about A Link Between Worlds. That's gotta be the #4 game for me, personally. It brought open-world back to the series before BotW and put players back into a familiar Hyrule before TotK. Wildly underrated and maybe the best overall 3DS game.

💬 Increase your FastAPI JSON response performance by 2x or more 🚄

1. Upgrade to the just released FastAPI 0.131.0 🎁
2. Declare your response model - return type ✨

With that, now @pydantic.dev handles the JSON serialization on the Rust side 🦀

💬 there's a theory that liberally adding contributors to a project makes them more involved and feel like they co-own it and it's good actually. you can still request a PR + ping me but if you find something obvious to fix I feel like you should be able to just merge it yourself.

💬 Python Tip #53 (of 365):

If you have hierarchical data to compare, consider relying on the lexicographical ordering of tuples. 🧵

Lexicographical ordering means "alphabetical-like ordering". We order English words intuitively. Ordering tuples actually works the same way.

💬 Let's say we have a list of 3-item (year, last, first) tuples:

students = [
    (1978, "Little", "Nancy"),
    (1978, "Gonzalez", "Maria"),
    (1977, "Anders", "Paul"),
    (1979, "Brady", "Doris"),
]

We could rely on lexicographical ordering to sort these by year, last name, and the first name.

----
**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 Sorting those tuples with the built-in sorted function:

sorted_students = sorted(students)

Will order them based on the first item in each tuple (year), then the second item (last name), then the third (first name).

This works because tuple comparisons rely on lexicographical ordering.

**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 Lexicographical ordering involves comparing item-by-item, starting with the first item in each tuple.

If the first item is different, its value determines the order of the tuples.

If the first item is the same, the next item is compared. If it's the same, the next item is compared, and so on.

💬 Rude, Claude - from one precariously named package to another

![Claude telling me not to move from Danger to Risk

Security Concerns 🚨

HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES:

    Unvetted Package: risk@0.0.4 is an extremely early version (0.0.x indicates pre-alpha). This poses significant security risks in a production environment.

    Reduced Dependencies: The yarn.lock shows extensive removal of gitbeaker dependencies (~740 deletions), but risk only adds minimal dependencies. This suggests either:
        Incomplete functionality compared to danger
        Different implementation approach
        Potential missing features

    No Version History: Version 0.0.4 suggests this package has had very limited testing and community review.
