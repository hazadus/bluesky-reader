💬 I wrote up this post after going through the Octoverse report for this past year!

It's super interesting and kind of obvious that because humans aren't writing as much code across codebases, they're leaning into stricter tooling that offers better reliability.

💬 Santa #Python came super early in 2026!

With build 1.4.0, it is now possible to easily dump effective package metadata!

So getting the version of a package in the current directory is now as easy as `pipx run build --metadata 2>/dev/null | jq -r .version`.

💬 This is NOT like parsing pyproject.toml or whatever. It builds the package and looks at the result. So it works even with https://setup.py.

If you're in a hurry:  `uvx --from build pyproject-build --installer=uv --metadata 2>/dev/null | jq -r .version`

💬 Python Tip #9 (of 365):

When checking for None in Python, use identity instead of equality. 🧵

Use "result is None" instead of "result == None".

Using identity works because Python's None is a sentinel value, meaning there's exactly one None object in Python.

**🕒 16:05 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 But... why use identity when checking for None?

Because that's what everyone else does, so seeing result == None looks weird.

Seriously. That's the real reason.

Well... there are 2 (less convincing) reasons:

1. It ensures that we're looking *only* for None
2. It's faster than an equality check

**🕒 16:05 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 For an equality check, an object could claim to be equal to None but identity can't be overloaded. So identity checks for one-and-only None object.

But in my opinion, that doesn't really matter... if an object wants to claim that it's equal to None, I don't see a good reason to stop it.

**🕒 16:05 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 I'm also not convinced by the "it's faster" argument. We do SO many other slightly slower things for readability's sake in Python!

So... we should use identity checks because it was declared a good idea and made its way into PEP8, which the community largely embraces as Python's style guide.

**🕒 16:05 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 But after the Introduction section in PEP 8, there's a section called "A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds" which argues that style guides should occasionally be broken.

I would recommend breaking this style rule but... I don't have a very good reason to break this rule!

**🕒 16:05 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 I don't have a great argument for following this rule nor a good reason to break it, so I think consistency with all other Python code in the wild should win out.

Use identity checks with None because PEP 8 says so.

So instead of:
value == None

Do this:
value is None

💬 it’s come to my attention that my tumblr post has been crossposted to bluesky, so I’m posting it on my account here #AntiAI #GenAI

![recently my friend's comics professor told her that it's acceptable to use gen AI for script-writing but not for art, since a machine can't generate meaningful artistic work. meanwhile, my sister's screenwriting professor said that they can use gen AI for concept art and visualization, but that it won't be able to generate a script that's any good. and at my job, it seems like each department says that AI can be useful in every field except the one that they know best.

It's only ever the jobs we're unfamiliar with that we assume can be replaced with automation. The more attuned we are with certain processes, crafts, and occupations, the more we realize that gen AI will never be able to provide a suitable replacement. The case for its existence relies on our ignorance of the work and skill required to do everything we don't.](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:gqskllykbmdonko5bx6yy5ur/bafkreibqyu5b5ka4t37fahw5vudadrmy2trhp63l7zko4syz7lile7drgi@jpeg)
