💬 Jacob’s Ladder is a good call. I should re-watch Pi, but I thought of including mother! which is peak Aronofsky imo.

Bloodsucking Freaks & Time Bandits are going on the to watch list — big fan of the other Gilliam movies I’ve seen.

💬 Ouch, very familiar:

💬 Now that the first draft of my PyCon UK keynote is done and my nerves are settling down a bit, why don't I check on the issues and PRs the accumulated on my FOSS projects…

💬 The Menu - I liked it — not quite bonkers enough imo
One Hour Photo - great thriller
The Cable Guy - cult classic brilliance
Tenebre - solid giallo, although I’m still partial to Suspiria
Synecdoche - maybe the most wtf Kaufman? will add

The rest: added to my to watch list. Thank you 🙏

💬 My first keynote draft left me in a weird melancholic state. I’m realizing that this is exactly the ONE keynote I can give right now. Everything’s in it that I have to give—including ALL my pet peeves. 🥰 

Maybe I can write another in 20 yrs; but not now.

Anyhow, tickets: 2025.pyconuk.org

💬 "an apple a day keeps the doctor away" became a saying in the nineteenth century. But year round apples only became available in the mid-twentieth century with the rise of controlled refrigerated storage. 🍎🧊

So people lived for decades aspiring to eat an apple every day but failing to do so...

💬 It was only in the past year that I understood that an apple eaten in July must have been picked in November and kept in controlled atmosphere storage for 8 months. I assumed apples were like tomatoes, where they've been bred to grow year round but the varieties that grow in-season taste best.

💬 The greenscreen virtual sets in "Jeepers Creepers: Reborn" are less “uncanny valley” and more like “uncanny canyon"

💬 My wife and I are both very online, but in extremely different ways, so we always have to begin our conversations with absurd setups.

Me: Ok, how much do you know about Watto from Star Wars Episode I?

Her: So you've heard about how lesbians are losing their minds over Kelly Clarkson, right?
