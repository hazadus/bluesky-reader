💬 Tree shaking and Dead Code Elimination are often used interchangeably but they are not the same!

While both work together to make your bundle smaller, there is a difference...

💬 A modern browser for the npm registry that nudges the ecosystem towards best practices and standards perfectly aligns with our mission: to make the next generation of JS developers more productive than ever before.

We're happy to support our friends at @npmx.dev!

💬 I know, I know; it's the drop-in replacement aspect that's appealing. It's a free upgrade if you're using Next.

Thing is: we're at least 2–5 years into our "Next is the worst modern option by a long shot" era, and people should really be looking at the other choices a lot more seriously.

💬 No reason to recommend against that stack, unless somebody wanted to stay entirely in JavaScript, in which case I'd say SvelteKit or Nuxt. Both have pretty much all the capabilities of Next at a fraction of the build/runtime bloat (and are generally easier to host).

💬 This is a very interesting request to the @typescriptlang.org docs

Definitely not a fan of phrases like 'beat a dead horse', 'kill two birds with one stone' etc with their explicit violence but 
not sure I agree with this premise. In part because duck typing is different from structural typing.

![A screenshot of the TypeScript Website github repo

The TypeScript documentation uses the term "duck typing" in two places when describing TypeScript's structural type system. While this is a widely-used computer science term, it derives from the "duck test" idiom ("If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck"), which instrumentalizes animals as metaphorical objects rather than sentient beings. The TypeScript docs already use the preferred alternative — "structural typing" — alongside it, making the transition straightforward.
Instances found

1. packages/documentation/copy/en/get-started/TS for JS Programmers.md (line 211)

    One of TypeScript's core principles is that type checking focuses on the shape that values have. This is sometimes called "duck typing" or "structural typing".

2. packages/documentation/copy/en/handbook-v1/Interfaces.md (line 13)

    This is sometimes called "duck typing" or "structural subtyping".

So I'm starting by shipping this in FastAPI. Next, Typer, SQLModel, etc. 🚀

Now it's time to ask your favorite coding agent to support it. 😎

💬 This was a fear of mine too, but FWIW (depending somewhat on your org), you get to choose which parts it does and doesn't do. You have control to redirect it, or use it as little as you like. 

I think even orgs that mandate usage will have a hard time both monitoring and enforcing compliance.

💬 For my part, I was an extremely pessimistic holdout until very recently. I would say I've been pleasantly surprised. I still get to write all the CSS I want, but I can tag out for the rote stuff that doesn't have any value to me (like package updates, for example).

It's not the loss I feared.
