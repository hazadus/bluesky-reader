💬 Since @dominikg.dev is in town for @vuefes.bsky.social we're doing a @svelte.dev Japan meetup on Friday at the beautiful DeNA office in Shibuya with an amazing view of Tokyo's skyline 🌃
Feel free to swing by, no matter the color of your preferred framework!

💬 I love diskcache, a Python local key/value store that can act like a small local subset of Redis. It stores Python values, expires them, has queues, mappings, and deques..

But it can do more than that.

💬 The main reasons for me to use Safari on macOS despite being behind on web standards is integration with its iOS siblings and performance. 1/3

💬 However: bookmark sync is unreliable and relatedly reading list is so janky too that I switched to GoodLinks. And somehow the UI gets increasingly sluggish until I restart it like an old Windows system.

I guess it's time for an experiment. 2/3

💬 Brave is mostly smoke and mirrors and full of web3 nonsense. I've heard very negative things about them and everything crypto is off-putting to me so it wasn't even in the first round. I'm hearing Zen is good too (Firefox-based).

💬 Some folks were worried that they'd sic thugs on the protestors or declare martial law. Instead they posted AI videos and complained. 

These people have no juice. Their supporters are cowards. They are are all bark and no bite. They collapse when we push back. Remember that.

💬 easing is everything

use different CSS timing functions per axis for motion paths 👨‍🍳

.p {
animation: x .8s var(--x-time), y .8s var(--y-time);
animation-composition: accumulate; 👈
}
@​keyframes x { to { translate: var(--x) 0 }
@​keyframes y { to { translate: 0 var(--y) }

💬 I have to assume people who think AI shows and movies would be just as good as the ones made by real humans must *also* think watching a ball being driven up and down the road in a Waymo is the same thing as watching a real football game.

💬 I benchmarked --help on a CLI with the ref implementation for PEP 810 (lazy imports).

Because my CLI moved imports into functions just before they get used, I got a speedup of x1.3.

Then I moved all the imports to the top like normal, and got a speedup of x2.9!

💬 We should talk more about how there are actual experts on cognition & intelligence, who have spent entire careers studying the topic across a wide range of fields, and yet seemingly nobody in tech even thinks to consult those experts before feeling fully qualified to opine on the sentience of LLMs.

💬 I observe that being in tech makes many people (particularly white dudes) feel smarter than they imagine most other people to be. In turn, they feel emboldened by an unearned sense of enlightenment, and therefore qualified to speak in areas where they haven't earned any credentials or expertise.

💬 I mean, all of tech just rolled up three years ago going "WE ARE EXPERTS ON INTELLIGENCE!" like a pack of anti-vaxxers busting into an epidemiology conference.

We need to acknowledge that hubris.
