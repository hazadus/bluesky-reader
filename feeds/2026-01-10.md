💬 I do love a thing, but I have four extra drawers to fill with stuff, so there's plenty of space if I would like to fill them, but I don't expect that I will. If I get a new thing, I print a new container and I put it in one of the empty drawers.

💬 For the time being, error reporting will be worse. I'm reviewing alternatives (including a new diagnostics crate). For markup it's.. back to YAML for now.

I'm sad about this just like I'm sad about the whole thing. I am not interested in migrating to forks of either of those projects. Thanks. (2/2)

💬 Python Tip #10 (of 365):

When checking for emptiness (or non-emptiness) in Python, use truthiness. 🧵

Instead of this:
if len(items) > 0:
    ...

Or this:
if len(items):
    ...

Do this:
if items:
    ...

💬 When an object is used in a boolean context (like in an "if" or "while" condition) it's implicitly converted to a boolean. This is called a "truth value" test, though colloquially it's pretty much always called "truthiness".

**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 For lists, strings, tuples, sets, dictionaries and pretty much all data structures (a.k.a. "collections"), a truthiness check is a non-emptiness check.

Meaning empty collections are falsey and non-empty ones are truthy.

----
**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 So truthiness can be used to check for non-emptiness.

That also means that falsiness can also be used to check for emptiness.

So for lists, this:
if not items:
    ...

Is equivalent to this:
if len(items) == 0:
    ...

**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 While you don't strictly NEED to rely on truthiness to check emptiness, I would recommend it.

This pattern may seem odd, but it's very common.

Once you've seen this pattern enough, the "is this non-empty" question starts to feel more sensible than "does this list have more than 0 items in it?"

**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 While you're at it, consider relying on truthiness for None and non-None checks as well.

So instead of this:
if match is not None:
    ...

You would write this:
if match:
    ...

It's common to see this convention used with regex utilities, often with a walrus operator: https://pym.dev/using-walrus-operator/

----
**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 This only works well for objects that will be either None or a truthy object.

So be careful NOT to rely on truthiness for None checks  if you need to distinguish between EMPTINESS and None.

For example this:
if name:
    ...

Would evaluate as false/falsey if name was None OR an empty string ("").
