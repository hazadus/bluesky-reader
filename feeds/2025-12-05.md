💬 Red Lobster never released a commercial with a jingle that went “Shrimply having a wonderful Fishmastime.” That’s why they went bankrupt.

💬 Did you know you can do

int(my_string, 0)

and Python will parse the string as if it's a literal? Super handy, and I only learned about it five minutes ago!

💬 I feel the dilemma is, that I feel responsible for being friendly and welcoming to make the experience nicer for newcomers to OSS, who may not yet know the manner well. 

But with AI messing this up, it's really hard to tell if it's a human behind I should take care or just AI doing terrible work.

We had an ICE scare yesterday and even though we’re afraid of the repercussions of being vocal, we feel that it’s also important to inform people that this is right at our front door. ICE is not some far away boogeyman. They are here right now, spreading fear in our community. 

We’re so grateful to our entire staff and their bravery. They did the right things and couldn’t have dealt with this situation in a better way. We are grateful to our community activists that came to support us from @miracmn @litosonlake and Monarcha. We hope that if you find yourself in the same situation, that you find these resources helpful.
