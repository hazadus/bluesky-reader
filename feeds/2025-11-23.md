💬 While i'm moving things around which is the least shit CI in your opinion?

(That you can self-host. Current status quo for me is Forgejo Actions, which is a weird clone of Github Actions. It would be nice if the CI solution I adopt is able to run builds in Kubernetes pods directly. )

💬 Just set up an S3 (well, S3-compatible) remote for my monorepo because... self-hosting Git is all fun and games until you have catastrophic data loss.

(I also push to GitHub, and of course, several of my computers have clones but — I was very anxious about this).

💬 I needed to see which packages were pulling in six. 

Two ways:

- uv tree --package six --invert → quick “who depends on this?” from uv.lock

- uv pip tree --package six --invert --show-version-specifiers → more pipdeptree-style, constraint-aware view from the actual env

💬 It's not unlike the frustration of Silksong, actually, but the boss fight lasts for months, your power-ups are actually just normal life things that were taken away from you that you gradually unlock again to get back to where you started, and you literally never get to take a break.

💬 The interface is very slick. It's very flexible in the way you track things. There's keyboard shortcuts for absolutely everything. Like someone else said, it feels, you can tell that it was built by people who are using it. And that matters a lot!

💬 But I guess, you know, you have to go ahead and try it for a while to really get the value. They have a 30-day business trial and you don't even need the business plan to do anything interesting. 

The GitHub integration is nice. I hope it integrates with my self-hosted GitLab, but time will tell.

💬 This was an interesting reply because it made me realize that not everyone does this. I know people vibecoding aren't reading the code, but the way I work is that every time the LLM writes code, I read the output and internalize it a little bit. (Which is how I guide the LLM to write better code.)

💬 I knew I liked computers, and I had a math teacher that I liked and respected tell me "you should consider being an engineer". I looked up if "computer engineering" was a thing, and it was. I got to college, did an embedded project as part of my first computer engineering course, and was 100% sold.

💬 one of the things that makes me most mad about genAI (and there are many) is we've been told there's not enough money for hiring. but there's billions poured into ai. 

so not enough money to hire workers. but infinite money to pour into technology whose goal is never having to pay workers again.
