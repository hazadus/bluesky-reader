💬 gutted to inform you that my design is in fact not nix at all but actually completely novel

I WANT TO MAKE IT BUT I HAVE 12 PROJECTS INFLIGHT

💬 ok so BASICALLY you write imperative code. in a non-turing-complete language. inside a runtime where everything is tracked (and recursion is forbidden etc. etc.)

💬 you call functions like rustc(), cxx() which create lazy build nodes. they _can_ be scheduled immediately but your code doesn't block on it until you try to access a property on them.

this lets the whole build/crate graph be discovered before you even need to schedule the first action.

**🕒 01:28 👤 @fasterthanli.me (amos)**
💬 a good reason to delay scheduling is that you get to do cargo feature unification.. like cargo itself does — crate A wants reqwest with json, crate B with xml (just an example), we can unify that, avoid linking two incompatible versions of a package in the same target.

💬 absolutely everything is tracked. input files obviously, toolchains, codegen inputs. we CAN do toolchain discovery through `rustup show` etc. but only through builtins, which are also tracked, and can be invalidated.

💬 actions are scheduled wherever fits (right toolchain for right target, etc.), you can do remote execution with this, or cross-compilation.

problem: the build graph is not static anymore. solution: record absolutely everything, time-travel debugging.

💬 tl;dr you write imperative code in a constrained language — runtime captures inputs, outputs, schedules actions opportunistically, there's a big CAS that saves everything, if we have a persistent server (a-la buck2) then we can save some disk I/O and ser/deser for sure.

💬 PS: I obviously need to prototype all this and it might be fun even if it turns out there are fundamental flaws with it so keep that in mind (you or anyone else reading) before poking a thousand holes in it or telling me it's gonna take 18 years and still not be deterministic

💬 oh I forgot a big selling point: building crate foo with different feature sets does NOT clobber the build cache, unlike cargo, which means you could have parallel 'regular' / 'miri' / 'asan' etc. builds in the cache without invalidating everything all the damn time

💬 buck has a hard phase split: analysis THEN execution. For them it's a feature. I'm okay with my build being a bit spicier — making it easier to do codegen and other dynamic stuff BUT probably harder to debug "why did X happen" (hence good debugging tools — but really I just want a web UI)

💬 I've only been thinking about this for like ~2 hours but a big design goal is "don't make the user state the obvious[1]"

[1] including whatever can be discovered from the environment.

I want it to scale up (remote execution, big nodes) but also scale down (a better Makefile).

💬 if you're just building 800 crates on your macbook, cargo can help a lot with building the graph — and you know, a lot of buhttps://build.rscripts look like they could be statically analyzed. and and and— point is, if it's made by rust devs in rust for rust devs then... we can have comfy defaults.

💬 oh for sure! I think you should be allowed to be as strict as you want, and I'd want my build system to be in charge of compiling C/C++ deps, but also.. I think it pays to be lenient when doing local dev, not /everything/ needs to be overspecified

💬 exactly so — because I'm certifiably unwell — I'm not above doing static analysis on those build script, for real. recognizing uses of cc isn't thaaaat involved. More complex cases will trip up the analyzer, ofc. And then fixups. With a package manager from day one. With CI. Etc.

💬 but, in my wonderful fictional build system (called bibi) there isn't two phases.

actions starts to get scheduled as soon as we cannot make anymore progress without doing so. we prioritize actions that are actively blocking bibi code. you can have 12 phases if you want. (not infinity, b/c fuel)

yes comrade, let's start a github org

depends how it's specified I guess?? I guess 'cloning a ref' could also be a query, but "when do we update the git repo" is.. another question.

same as "when do we re-discover system libs/gcc/etc." — don't want to do it every build, do we.

💬 two cases:
1) it's actually for the same target, in which case, like I said, we don't schedule until it's _the only way to make progress_ (we've exhausted evaluating all the functions), at which point we have collected all features, or:
2) different target (build script etc.) — totally fine

💬 My two cents for library bundling:

* Use tsdown in most cases
* If you need super customized or an even more programmatic setup use Rolldown
* Current Vite lib mode is the last choice - only if you do need Vite-specific functionalities

FYI: tsdown will be the base of the future Vite lib mode!

💬 Apparently I'm pretty consistent with what I talk about on Bluesky. 😅 ... also I use that 😅 emoji a lot

My most-used words in 2025 were:

1. "python" (360×)
2. "code" (43×)
3. "function" (39×)
4. "pyconus" (36×)
5. "morsels" (35×)

See which words you used the most here: anisota.net/harvest
