💬 “[Being a parent] has made me both  care more and less”

SO TRUE! Also, shout out to the primary parents who work in tech.

Raising two toddlers is hard enough. You know what’s even harder? Having to dip out of important meetings or break flow when daycare calls unexpectedly.

💬 It's OK if you don't see the value in it

To me, being able to allow any atproto app to reliably say 'this atproto user has verifiably claimed to own this account' means that something like @npmx.dev can now know what packages a bluesky user has write access to

For me, it's for helping the indies

💬 That if-elif chain disguised data as logic. The dictionary makes it clearer that this bit of code is data-heavy, but not actually very logic-heavy.

Dictionaries "map" keys to values, so whenever you find yourself wanting to map from one kind of thing to another think of a dictionary.
