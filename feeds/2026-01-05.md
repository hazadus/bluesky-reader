💬 I saw that too and also appreciated the framing, even though most days I personally feel like I'm more towards the flip side of that sentiment

💬 Guillermo del Toro gets it. 

https://variety.com/2026/film/news/guillermo-del-toro-art-not-important-prelude-to-fascism-1236623278/

!["Be kind, be involved, believe in your art," he said. "At a time when people tell you art is not important, that is always the prelude to fascism. When they tell you it doesn't matter, when they tell you a fucking app can do art you say, if it's that important, why the fuck do they want it so bad? The answer is because they think they can debase everything that makes us a little better, a little more human. And that, in my book, and in my life, includes monsters."](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:wq3tpey2deirk4wz6ft2htbf/bafkreif4wyo37hkb2myy3sne4ods7is5ro6jxlrvojrdwktsajz7jj253i@jpeg)

💬 Got played by AI good recently. 

I had a passing test suite, but looking at it closely, all the tests were marked as @pytest.mark.skip :D

A good reminder that 100% coverage means nothing and to, of course, check that the genie granted you the wish you wanted, not just the wish you asked for.

💬 "I want to grow, but my manager isn't giving me the right opportunities."

I hear this a lot. Here's the thing: even the best manager can only do so much. If you want growth, start creating your own opportunities.

💬 Minnesota has to come first - always.

Today, I’m proud of the work we’ve done to make Minnesota the best place to live and raise kids.

I’ve decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.

💬 I gave a lightning talk at a bunch of conferences in 2025 about some of the exciting new things coming in Python 3.14, including t-strings.

I illustrated this with xkcd 327, and localised it for the PyCon I was at. Here they are!

💬 Python Tip #5 (of 365):

Use sensible chained comparisons in Python, like a < b < c 🧵

**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 Unlike many programming languages, you can chain comparison operators in Python.

Meaning this:

if 0 < x and x < 10:
    ...

Can be rewritten as this:

if 0 < x < 10:
    ...

I recommend embracing this feature.

**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 Some folks avoid chained comparisons because in many languages, "0 < x < 10" is valid but would actually be a sneaky bug.

If this feels like a bug-waiting-to-happen for your polyglot team, then avoid this feature.

But if "it only works properly in Python" doesn't scare you, then embrace this!

💬 So replace this:
0  x

With this:
0  10

With this:
not (0 <= x <= 10)

And consider replacing this:
x == y and y == z

With this:
x == y == z

💬 Yes, embracing this feature comes with the risk of giving folks the false impression that this feature might work in other languages.

But I think in many case that this risk might be worth it.

💬 I will note that chained comparisons can absolutely be misused.

I don't recommend doing this:
x != y != z != x

Or this:
"?" not in phrase in options

Using a chained comparison for != or the "in" operator makes for some VERY confusing code.

💬 Chained comparisons work with any binary comparison, but it's confusing to use this feature with anything but < or ==.

For practice with chained comparisons, try this exercise: https://pym.dev/exercises/3191fdc62b37416f82821de8bd654170/

Just a heads up: this week's daily Python tips will all be about Boolean expressions.

💬 I really resisted, but Iast week vibed coded for real, without looking at the code. The results were above my expectations. 

The software worked very well, passed 100% coverage, linter, type checker, and deployment was done automatically.

Looked at the code after deployment.

It's clean.

Damn.
