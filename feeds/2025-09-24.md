💬 Building performant tools doesn't happen by accident. They need a strong foundation!

@rolldown.rs and @vite.dev 8 are powered by Oxc for that reason

We've evaluated all previous PRs that went into the Oxidation compiler, https://gist.github.com/Boshen/7ee09b4cd22fcb8146b75f55c5ac5321

This is what foundational work looks like!

💬 today in "why computers why", Apple's Translate app turns "Jajniki" (Polish) into "Overies" (US English), instead of "Ovaries".

I've looked everywhere and can't find traces of that spelling online. Trying to translate back yields nothing since, well, it's not a word.

💬 stty

https://wizardzines.com/comics/stty/

(from The Secret Rules of the Terminal, out now! https://wizardzines.com/zines/terminal/)

![your TTY driver has configuration

you can see how it’s configured by running:

stty -a

for example it print out the current window size!
Ctrl+S

by default, pressing Ctrl+S wi(( freeze your terminal (and Ctrl+Q wi(( unfreeze) I have never wanted this in my life, you can turn it off with stty -ixon (fish turns it off by default)

###fun fact: changing Ctrl+C technically you can use stty to set a different keyboard shortcut for Ctrl+C, (ike “u”

stty intr u

this is extremely chaotic and I can’t imagine a reason that I would ever do this though
programs have to configure the TTY driver to get friendly features

developer: I want arrow keys to work in my program!

other person: better tell the TTY driver to turn off canonical mode! (more on the next page)
the TTY driver’s settings are called “termios settings”

for the gnarly details:

man termios

but if you’re writing a terminal program libraries like readline or ncurses will handle setting up the TTY driver
panel 6

smiling stick figure with short curly hair: I’ve only needed to use stty once in the last 20 years and I mostly don’t understand its output but I think it’s a fun view into terminal internals!

💬 On my way back from #PyConUK with the usual full heart/empty head that I tend to have after Python conferences.

💬 A big surprise was that it was probably the most diverse conference I've ever attended. No matter where you looked, you always saw a nontrivial amount of not-white-dudes. I know this doesn't happen by accident, so huge props to the organizers (on top of the props for flawless execution). 2/4

💬 Lastly, I'm still fascinated by how warmly the UK community has adopted me—unlike… others. It's been only my 2nd PyCon UK but it felt like coming home. I guess there's some "humor" alignment, as shown by the fact that many keynote compliments came with a "also love your feud with Judy". 🤣 4/4

💬 I'd recommend Super Metroid. Zero Mission keeps getting picked because it's technically first in story order, but gameplay-wise, it's just average for the series.

Super also starts with a good recap of the story thus far, so you won't really miss anything. Then you can go back or forward from there

💬 Super is a masterclass in atmospherics and visual storytelling, arguably Nintendo's most daring game ever, and basically the original Metroidvania.

Zero Mission is just a mishmash of other Metroid games.
