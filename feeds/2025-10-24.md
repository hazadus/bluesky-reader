💬 We are still looking for feedback on tsgo, but it is worth calling out we expect some type-checking changes that you may need to adapt to. 

The native previews are easy to grab from npm, and are published nightly to try out!

💬 We stopped shipping new JavaScript frameworks every week so now I guess we're shipping new AI browsers every week.

💬 Going to report a bug literally any Python project on GitHub to find @hugovk.dev already got there before you, reported it and fixed it. Every time.

💬 I used to love libs like click, typer, loguru, structlog, etc., that made annoying API simple. But now with LLM, this boilerplate writes itself, and I seem to never need to import those anymore outside of my clients that don't want AI in their turf.

💬 A friend had an idea yesterday. Coding it would have taken 2 months for him in the past. He got something working in a day with Claude code, with insightful logs and deployment included. In 48h he will know if it was a good or bad idea.

💬 I had a new architecture with new lib to try this week. It knew a lot of doc reading and experimenting with its API and different project structures was necessary, and would take a day.

I fired an agent, and the new Slow horses season. I had everything I needed to know after 2 episodes, with tests.

💬 There was 5 completely different approaches I had to try, several I didn't even know existed before I started. Each came with heavy refactoring and reshaping.

💬 I didn't have to write any of it. At the send, I selected one, cleaned it up manually, and had what I would have written myself in a day. In 2 hours.

I still a lot manually (many of my clients don't accept AI generated code). But I bill by the day, so it's their loss.

💬 Lots of AI post today, because I wanted to share practical things about it. Just day to day things, about the tedious mountain work, and not some magical hyperbolic use case.

My AI use is akin to cleaning toilets not going to the moon. But that's what I need, and it's good at it.

💬 Claude code for web is really something:

Also love the fact that the automatic subtitles call it "clawed code". That's a killer domain name.

If you're copy-pasting AI responses as code review feedback, you're not helping. You're just creating more work for everyone else. 
Your teammates need YOUR thoughts, not ChatGPT's generic advice.

there was a technical issue on our end that prevented a small number of new posts and accounts from getting indexed.

we're backfilling the missing data now, and search results should return to normal soon.
