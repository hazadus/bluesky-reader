💬 TIL about Autoconf quadrigraphs and I'm screaming

![8.1.6 Quadrigraphs

When writing an Autoconf macro you may occasionally need to generate special characters that are difficult to express with the standard Autoconf quoting rules. For example, you may need to output the regular expression ‘[^[]’, which matches any character other than ‘[’. This expression contains unbalanced brackets so it cannot be put easily into an M4 macro.

Additionally, there are a few m4sugar macros (such as m4_split and m4_expand) which internally use special markers in addition to the regular quoting characters. If the arguments to these macros contain the literal strings ‘-=<{(’ or ‘)}>=-’, the macros might behave incorrectly.

You can work around these problems by using one of the following quadrigraphs:

‘@<:@’
    ‘[’
‘@:>@’
    ‘]’
‘@S|@’
    ‘$’
‘@%:@’
    ‘#’
‘@{:@’
    ‘(’
‘@:}@’
    ‘)’
‘@&t@’
    Expands to nothing. 

Quadrigraphs are replaced at a late stage of the translation process, after m4 is run, so they do not get in the way of M4 quoting. For example, the string ‘^@<:@’, independently of its quotation, appears as ‘^[’ in the output. ](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:g4kfvq6qttlpqiwfzmz2o73c/bafkreif2t6o6i6yyctzvhxzvhiufiyn6uwas6mgtsnvhi3xsnbel6umoue@jpeg)

💬 I started because in 2024 my wife went almost every day, and looked great from it. For the first few months it was possible to treat it like a shower and use it for deep thinking.

Now I push it pretty hard, and it's not really good thinking time anymore. Which is fine, trade-offs.

💬 HUGE day for Deno! 🎉

- The all-new, completely rebuilt Deno Deploy is now in GA
- If that weren't enough: we're ALSO launching Deno Sandbox!

Deno Sandboxes are on-demand, isolated safe zones that run on Deno Deploy. Perfect for running any untrusted code (like from an LLM, or from end users).

💬 Python Tip #34 (of 365):

Remember that in Python, functions are objects. 🧵

If you need to call a bit of code later, you don't need to make a class with a method... you could just make a function!

💬 Python's functions are objects and they can be passed around just like any object.

For example, to customize how you sort an iterable, you can specify a key function.

def length_first(s): return (len(s), s)

sorted_words =sorted(words, key=length_first)

💬 You can even write your own functions that accept a function as an argument.

Functions are callable objects, so if you write a function that assumes that you can call one of the passed-in objects (by putting parentheses after a reference to it) then you've made a function that accepts a function.

💬 Instead of making a class instance that's passed around to later call the run a method:

class Normalizer:
    def run(self, text):
        return text.casefold().strip()

normalizer = Normalizer()

You could just pass a function around:

def normalize(text):
    return text.casefold().strip()
