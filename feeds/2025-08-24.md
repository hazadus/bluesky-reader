💬 I suppose; but I find the lack of consistency frustrating - mostly when I realize I’ve built up a fancy iterative chain and now can’t use it

💬 fascinating

![Claude says: A Google Books Ngram Viewer chart tracking the usage frequency of two phrases in English books from 1800 to 2022. The red line shows "from the jaws of defeat" and the blue line shows "from the jaws of victory." The red line demonstrates early usage starting around 1820, with notable peaks in the 1860s-1880s, followed by decline and then steady growth from the 1940s onward. The blue line remains nearly flat until around 1960, then shows rapid growth starting in the 1970s. Both phrases experience dramatic increases from the 1980s through 2020, with their usage converging at high levels by the end of the time period. The chart shows that while "from the jaws of defeat" appeared earlier in literature, "from the jaws of victory" eventually caught up and slightly exceeded it in recent decades.](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:sl3g3nhnad34sfhjnqdivbzd/bafkreicmkbqszwcboci22jndervi6775rubccnf4ymnu5xvmgbptraxkga@jpeg)

💬 Why the "declare AI help in your PR" is useless, courtesy of 3000 years ago logic:

- If you can't tell without the disclaimer, it's useless: people will not tell.

- If you can tell, it's useless: you can tell.

Just evaluate quality, not process.

💬 I wouldn't address arrogance by holding back deserved praise — that is manipulative.

appreciate the good someone does, and where appropriate, give constructive feedback:

● if in doubt, ask permission first
● rooted in relationship
● describes cause -> effect
● non-judgemental

![You seem like a wise person and a good leader. 
Do you think there's ever a reason to hold back on praise for someone, even if they did a good job? We all know encouraging teams is important, but sometimes a person already seems arrogant, and praise might make it worse. Do you think this is ever the case? What is your advice on dealing with people who seem arrogant to you?](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:jbeaa5kdaladzwq3r7f5xgwe/bafkreibvxoschs6zjhxcssuitced44pq4co4ada6wwnfiqt7qqqupv2e6i@jpeg)

💬 Just once, I wish Democrats would reject the absurd premise that fascism was ushered in by leftists trying to be *too* inclusive, and that the fascism can be defeated by simply doing whatever the fascists want.

💬 This is essentially just "is a hotdog a sandwich?" in different packaging.

Is the prompter technically building websites? Sure.

Is that what anyone means when they use the term "web developer"? No.

💬 Besides which, the idea that any message capability you have with AI confers on you the job title of a professional is both ridiculous and dangerous. 

Do you get to call yourself an accountant if AI helps you make a spreadsheet? 

If you diagnose something with AI, are you a doctor? 

Of course not

💬 Following the logic through, anyone capable of using an LLM to build a website should be able to apply to a web developer job—or vice versa; that a web dev posting is seeking out prompters.

Even if you call the end result a website in both cases, they're clearly different practices.

💬 the question was about two unrelated things:
 1) a dev comes across as arrogant
 2) they do some good work

and ... the q: is an appropriate response to the arrogance to withhold praise for the good work?

clearly, no, it is not appropriate.

instead, deal _directly_ with the arrogance.

💬 You're both still using the same flawed logic.

"There was not a diagnosis before, then I typed some stuff into an LLM, and now there is, so I'm a doctor."

It's only possible to arrive at this conclusion if you embrace a wholly inaccurate definition of the term you're bestowing.

💬 If you think that all web developer means is a person who makes a website appear, then sure, I can understand why this argument would seem to make sense. But to me and to many others, that is a gross misrepresentation of what the term actually means.
