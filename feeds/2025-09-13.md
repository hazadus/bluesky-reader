💬 I do not believe there is a god, because no god could allow something as cruel as Silksong to exist

💬 Released 0.1.1 of `troml`, a tool that suggests classifiers, i.e. https://pypi.org/classifiers/, for #Python packages.

It looks at `project.python-requires` and dependencies in `pyproject.toml`, and for a `py.typed` file.

💬 I'm so sick of everything in Silksong doing double damage 

After seven years in development, they could have at least have made the game *genuinely* challenging, instead of just artificially nerfing your character down to half health.

It feels lazy, and it's such a lousy gameplay experience.

💬 Hopefully you see this when you land:

If you're flying transcontinental in business (or better) class usually you'll have access to a lounge at the destination which has breakfast(!) and a hot shower(!!) and it is ABSOLUTELY worth it to take advantage of both.

💬 The last boss is very clearly a Radiance clone, and—guess what?—has a *three-damage* attack.

Because when you've wasted the last 2/3 of the game on unoriginal hacks to make it harder, the only remaining move is to double down on the unoriginal hacks.

Kinda surprised it took this long, honestly.

💬 Thing is: despite my obnoxious posting through it, I actually really like Silksong overall. I just strongly dislike a lot of the small choices Team Cherry made with this one—largely either to try to make it *too* much the same as the first, or to hyper-focus on the extreme hardcore git gud bros.

💬 "Glow" on Netflix (technically three seasons before it got cancelled in the pandemic) is IMO the best show to come out of the whole first decade of the streaming era. It's hilarious, it's heartbreaking, it's so '80s, every single character gets the spotlight, and Marc Maron deserved an Emmy.

💬 Finally got back to my picross game for the #Nintendo E-Reader. The engine is done! Now just polish, polish, tweaks, and more polish.

It can support up to 255 puzzles, which live on their own cards. I'm going to have about 40-60 puzzles at release.

💬 Game idea: heavy metal song lyric, or quote from my very pregnant wife?

- I don't know what's going on inside of me

- Why is it trying to kill me from within 

- I can't sleep anymore

- It wants to get out 

- My body is no longer mine 

- Stop this pain inside me 

- You're getting a vasectomy

💬 The overhead between Rust<>JS is greatly reduced through a lot of things:

* Plugin Hook Filters (Less JS Function Calls)
* Raw Transfer (no 2x AST parsing but sharing it as a SharedArrayBuffer)
* Lazy Deserialization (Only target the nodes you need)

And more!
