💬 Yes, the bundle deals are:

3 books together with $15 discount = 44 * 3 - 15 = 132 - 15 = 117

2 books with $10 discount = 44 * 2 - 10 = 88 - 10 = 78

Unless I am missing something?

💬 Being into classical music is a trip because if you like a requiem or a concerto or something, you might have to listen to four hundred and twenty-seven different recordings to find out which is best. This opens a whole new dimension of snobbery, sign me up.

💬 The Mozilla AI announcement (https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/rewiring-mozilla-ai-and-web/) should only make you sad if you still believe that Mozilla was still relevant somehow? Also as far as AI goes it's not like.. the worst kind? I don't know. Might revise opinions after coffee.

💬 Depends on the tool I'd say 👀

I also don't mind talking about more early-stage tooling tbh, especially as (potential) users can still weigh in and influence the direction they move easier than when it is more mature (e.g. the Oxfmt RFC)

💬 in this case I checked out the pr locally, looked at the test and determined it was incorrect

then I reverted the pr and logged to see if it did anything, and verified that it did not in fact do anything

I have now asked for a reproduction

at worst case, it's a bug report

at best, it's the gateway to someone becoming a valued contributor!

💬 Scientists wanted to know if crows could tell good tools from worse tools.

So they put two crows together, with two bits of food that required a tool to get; one better, and one worse.

Theory: they'd fight over the good tool.

Reality: they worked together to improve the worse one, then both ate.

💬 Incidentally, the tools in question were wires. Meat was placed down inside bottles, and the crows were given one perfectly curved wire hook, along with a straight wire that might have worked, but would've been harder to use. 

The crows (total strangers, BTW) cooperated to bend the straight wire.

💬 i can see it going either way, honestly

in some cases it absolutely is the ‘first taste’. maintainer asks for changes, a few dms are exchanged.

in others, not so much.

but i can tell you that it’s 100% better than vibe coded prs _without_ disclaimers - and those are pretty frequent
