💬 Should be fine from the looks of it, _target means it will always be running code that you have already merged

💬 It's interesting how I used to stress over cleaning up every sentence I wrote, and now I'm like, "eh, if something is a little clunky, at least people will know it's me that wrote it instead of AI"

💬 I’m sorry about that. It was not appropriate and we should have handled it better.

💬 So I'm working on a tool that needs to capture where in the source code you do a certain operation. And I came up with this very complicated scheme with macros expanding to extension traits, and spent two days implementing it before I realized: I can just use DWARF. I'm just going to use DWARF.

💬 What's cool about making tools that are not meant for every use case ever is that you get to decide what the constraints are. e.g. I'm going to require frame pointers! That way backtrace collection is cheap, symbolication happens out of process asynchronously anyway, everyone's happy.

💬 And I had to silence my inner critic like, isn't debug information heavy? No, first of all, you can split it off, you can compress it and you can have line-tables-only. And that's enough for my purpose. So no, it's fine.

💬 But now I'm in the business of capturing backtraces and symbolicating them. And although what I was building was initially an async deadlock debugger, it's very hard to not immediately think of turning it into a sampling CPU & allocation profiler, you know? Because... because I can.

💬 As usual, those extra features are vaporware atm. But if I already built an interactive React dashboard with advanced filtering that is connected to a local web server, to whom instrumented 'target' processes attach and send regular snapshots about async activity... I might as well send more things!

💬 So this gives you a line number, a column number, and a file path that might be relative to something that you don't know, which is not great. And it's also "just" the parent frame, and it's very easy to accidentally not use track_caller for some reason, or it's impractical to use track_caller.

**🕒 12:01 👤 @fasterthanli.me (amos)**
💬 So it's actually what I'm moving away from. This is what my macro scheme was based on. It was half, okay, you need macros to be able to resolve those relative paths, like record the base of that.

**🕒 12:01 👤 @fasterthanli.me (amos)**
💬 And then you need track_caller and Location::caller() to be able to get the other half. And if you get the two together with some heuristics, you can recover the crate name and the module path... It was a huge hack anyway, and very unergonomic.

💬 I think I can take the performance hit of walking frame pointers and capturing those and interning those. And it gives me much richer information about, you know, where, for example, what was the last backtrace when we polled that feature before it went pending forever?

**🕒 12:02 👤 @fasterthanli.me (amos)**
💬 And with debug info, I can actually reliably turn the entire backtrace into absolute paths to Rust source with line numbers and column, which means I can show code inline in the frontend of my tool, Because when exploring large code bases, it's normal to forget what some part of the code did!

💬 I read that Atlantic measles piece before the backlash, and at no point did I ever think it was actually a real story.

Honestly I kinda think the fact that there's been such a backlash about it has more to do with people's reading ability than it does what was written.

It's in first-person, FFS.

💬 👀 yessssss

![On the left, there’s a graph with 4 nodes, and they’re all in a cycle. That’s great because it’s a deadlock, and it’s really easy to see it’s a deadlock when it’s in a cycle.

On the right, there’s a backtrace with a bunch of frames. The frames are mangled names, but in the next screenshot they’re going to be unmangled.

That’s it. I’ve got to go for dinner because my wife is waiting for me. Okay, bye. ](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:dqrcz4py2hrv4lzcs6ygoagj/bafkreif5gwqkgcxgawxy75klhhgzxqa4llq3ej3gdowojapeaq2vf6g5xm@jpeg)

💬 Python Tip #51 (of 365):

Consider replacing slices with extended tuple unpacking. 🧵

Instead of this:
command = tokens[0]
args = tokens[1:]

Consider this:
command, *args = tokens

Or maybe even this (see tip 49):
[command, *args] = tokens

💬 Using traditional tuple unpacking requires knowing the size of the iterable you're unpacking.

Extended tuple unpacking (with a *) allows unpacking an iterable of an unknown size.
