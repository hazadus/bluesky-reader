💬 It is consistently baffling to me that every app under the sun has profile pics in tiny little bubbles, but only like 10% of them actually have a plan for what happens if you want to click through what that person looks like at larger than like 64px.

💬 Interesting yeah, I have just learned about strongRefs / CIDs yesterday - I concur they're the right path for relational integrity!

I agree, a structural version of this would need some kind of key auto-rotation yeah. Hadn't considered that timestamps are untrusted, but makes sense

💬 Last time, I don't think it was actually causing the hang, but this time, under a lot of pressure, all the tokio worker threads were trying to spawn rustc at the same time, and there were no threads left to service VFS operations.

Which means... it's time to give VFS its own tokio runtime.

💬 Python Tip #37 (of 365):

Avoid overusing the term "method". 🧵

In Python, the words "function" and "method" are not interchangeable.

All methods are functions, but not all functions are methods.

💬 For example, here we're passing a string to the len function:

>>> message = "This is Python"
>>> len(message)
18

And here we're calling the lower method on the same string:

>>> message.lower()
"this is python"

💬 You might assume "is there a period?" would be a good method identification heuristic.

While a period DOES indicate an attribute lookup, it doesn't necessarily indicate a method call.

This isn't a method call:
>>> import math
>>> math.sqrt(25)
5.0

We're calling the math module's sqrt function.

**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 So what's the difference between a method and a function?

Well, if every object with a specific type has a function attached to it that operates on objects with that type, then that function is a method.

Not every module object has a sqrt function. But every string has a lower method!

**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 Methods are functions that are attached to a particular class and are used via the attribute lookup syntax ("some_object.some_attribute").

So there is no print method or len method in Python, but there is a print function and there is a len function.
