💬 I think everybody should start exercising *extreme* skepticism towards everything they read having anything at all to do with AI, no matter what it is.

Both pro- and anti-AI content is a viable means to virality right now, which means there's bound to be floods of disinformation going both ways.

💬 I'm seeing a lot of people on both sides almost automatically sharing anything that sounds like something they agree with, and that's actively harmful. That makes you both a target for, and a potential spreader of disinformation. 

We've got to be more critical than that.

💬 simply, more OSS projects should DO THIS.

OSS is a long playing game, if not forever. but we are people behind those projects, and we need good rest and balance to keep things sustainable. I am super happy to see this move and looking forward to see how it could change how OSS works for all of us.

💬 Also learned a lot from this thread today. 

Somehow, I never drew the connection between neighborhood watches and racism. I thought they were just bored old people who liked snooping on their neighbors. But suddenly I'm realizing there was another obvious common characteristic.

💬 yeah, it does look like some masto instances are very resistant to remote API usage (likely to avoid scrapers / federation level search etc)

💬 Python Tip #46 (of 365):

Use non-primitive objects as dictionary keys. 🧵

The phrase "primitive types" isn't in the Python docs, but folks sometimes borrow that phrase from other language to refer to strings, numbers, & bools.

Those are NOT the only valid dictionary keys!

💬 Any hashable object can be used as a dictionary key.

That includes strings and numbers, but also other objects, like tuples!

>>> coordinates = {(0, 1): "purple", (5, 4): "green"}
>>> coordinates[(0, 1)]
'purple'

Hashable objects tend to be immutable: https://pym.dev/what-are-hashable-objects/

💬 tuples and frozenset objects and other immutable objects are BY FAR the most common dictionary keys.

The most common dictionary keys are probably:
•  Strings
•  Integers
•  Various custom hashables (pathlib.Path, datetime‍.date, etc.)
•  Tuples
•  Frozen sets
