💬 TIL that this tier doesn't come with Chromecast support and hasn't for years. Is it any wonder that this company is so thoroughly hated? 😠

💬 On a AI believer scale of 1–10, I'd say I'm no higher than like a 3. So to me, sure, I recognize it as an impressive technology with some practical applications. But I observe much more reason for skepticism than awe in terms of both its actual abilities and its societal ramifications.

💬 AI is the belief that everything will be perfect if we just give enough to the wealthy, applied to technology.

It is market fundamentalism taken to its ultimate conclusion; a tool to funnel money and power upward, into as few hands as possible, under the false promise of eventual societal benefit.

💬 It has somehow only been just today that I realized the parallels between market fundamentalism and AI Messianism.

Both promise that if we just give enough to those who already have the most, they'll make everything good for all the rest of us.

In both cases, it will never actually happen.

💬 There is no future where AI solves all our problems, in just the same way that abolishing regulations and getting out of the way of the rich to allow them to do whatever they want never built a better future for workers—and for all the same reasons.

💬 There is never going to be a line where the wealthy and powerful say "ok, we've got enough now. You can stop working as hard. Here's more pay."

There will never come a point where their gain translates in any meaningful trickle down to the rest of us. Every possible benefit will go to the top.

💬 Stumbled across an interesting (aggravating) bug in Safari today:

If you use `:has()` together with `:empty`, even if the empty element ceases to be empty (by adding children with JS, say), the DOM is apparently "cached," and the `:empty` selector will still apply.

💬 You can see the new elements in dev tools. They're there; the list is definitely no longer empty. But Safari still *thinks* it is, and continues applying the `:empty` selector, until and unless something else forces a style recalculation. (Sometimes even just opening dev tools seems to do it.)
