💬 if you are mad at on open source project, bashing it on social media doesn’t help anyone and doesn’t even boost ego that much

💬 🐙 I built OctoStore: leader election and locking as a service.

No etcd cluster. No Consul. No ZooKeeper. Start locking via HTTP.

Single 🦀 binary. Self-hostable. Free hosted version.

No business model. Just a thing that should exist.

💬 I am proud of you and our immigrant residents. Your resiliency, strength, and dedication have led to the announcement that “Operation Metro Surge” will end soon. 1/

![Dear neighbor,


I am proud of you and our immigrant residents. Your resiliency, strength, and dedication have led to the announcement that “Operation Metro Surge” will end soon. It’s clear that the commitment of our neighbors made it untenable for ICE and federal agents to continue to operate its occupation of our city and state. This isn’t as a result of capitulation from elected leaders. This victory is yours, but we must not stop until ICE is completely abolished, and no more families are ever separated again. 


I will forever be thankful to those who patrolled, observed, and supported our community with mutual aid and daily tasks during these horrific times. Our community is full of heroes who will always be remembered as caring and loving. There are no words to show how thankful I am of every single one of you who showed up day in and day out. I hope you’ll join me in continuing to carry the whistle of resistance as our work is not done.


I am still asking the community to remain cautious and vigilant until we can confirm what this truly means. They said they are not backing down from mass deportation but will be ending the operation in Minnesota soon. I recommend you continue your current plan until we can give you more information. We still need observers and the community to be on the lookout. These “draw-downs” are expected to continue through next week, which means we will still need help now and in the future.


Additionally, we must never forget what they did to our neighbors and loved ones. They murdered Renee Good and Alex Pretti, shot Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis in the leg, and kidnapped Victor Manuel Diaz, who then died under ICE custody. We are still mourning, demanding justice, and we will never forget. They targeted our immigrant neighbors and children, discriminated against our community based on skin color and accents, lobbed weapons of war on our parks, and completely shattered families who simply wanted to work, take their kids to schools, and](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:vemv3cn7hjz2v46xgg5pmfu7/bafkreicedlhsvyzaval6fvsjvsv3dbbdtlajdbrqlgdugypmh6pccgbkti@jpeg)

💬 Python Tip #43 (of 365):

Be skeptical of loops over dictionaries. 🧵

If you find yourself looping over a dictionary, ask yourself "why am I looping here" and "do I really need a dictionary?".

💬 When using dictionaries for grouping items by a key or for counting occurrences of items, it's common to build up the dictionary in a loop and then later loop over the keys and values.

for word, n in counts.items():
    print(f"{word} appeared {n} times")

Dictionaries are GREAT for this.

**🕒 23:45 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 Dictionaries are also great for mapping keys to values in general.

If you need to quickly look up values based on their keys, use a dictionary!

>>> counts["ducks"]
3

But if you find yourself making a dictionary of known key-value pairs and then looping over it, you may not need a dictionary.

💬 Instead of this dictionary:

counts = {"computers": 2, "cats": 1, "ducks": 3}
for name, n in counts.items():
    print(n, name)

You could use a list of 2-item tuples:

counts = [("computers", 2), ("cats", 1), ("ducks", 3)]
for name, n in counts:
    print(n, name)

Looping over a dictionary isn't always a sign that something is wrong, but be suspicious of code that loops over dictionaries.
