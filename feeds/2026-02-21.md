💬 just fixed tracey hover — so you can see the rule you're implementing just by hovering it

github.com/bearcove/tra...

![I'm in my text editor, looking at some Rust code, hovering a rule, the rule is named daemon.logs.file. It says the daemon must provide all log output to .tracy/daemon.log in the workspace root. ](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:dqrcz4py2hrv4lzcs6ygoagj/bafkreidf2ic3a3o2pw5okjxio3vk23nbsc7h52i6iib2f3oegnapnwe4i4@jpeg)

💬 Oh, and I recently added versioning support for rules:
- optional pre-commit hook stops you from changing rule text without also bumping its version (via `tracey bump`)
- stale implementation sites get a warning diagnostic that you can hover to see a word-level diff of the rule text

![I'm in my text editor again. I am hovering over a rule marker in my code that says implementation must be changed to match updated rule text. And only once that's done must the code annotation be bumped. Then it says in the hover changes from previous version.

And in this case, it's a rule about requirement definitions. And you can see that the old wording is stricken. So it says the old version used to say the prefix identifies which spec this requirement belongs to configured by prefix. And now it says the prefix may be any lowercase alphanumeric marker, for example, R, REC, or H2.

So it's extremely convenient because you can see everything that's changed. ](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:dqrcz4py2hrv4lzcs6ygoagj/bafkreicrbutggf6vnfu2uepnk4ebpfgxopsl2pqwpxdjwahvopjipsxd2q@jpeg)

💬 I believe atproto is decentralized. 

Now I may be partial because I’ve worked in it for a while. But It’s all there, and it works in this fashion at scale. 

I think sometimes it ends up being an issue and it’s not someone’s favorite way to the decentralize things and that’s perfectly okay.

💬 Python Tip #52 (of 365):

Use deep tuple unpacking (when it's helpful). 🧵

Instead of this:
for n, value in iterable:
    item, color = value
    ...

Do this:
for n, (item, color) in iterable:
    ...

💬 Tip 49 (list-like tuple unpacking) included a deep tuple unpacking example:
[(item, max_count)] = Counter(items).most_common(1)

That line unpacks a single-item list with a 2-item tuple inside it into 2 variables.

Compare that to this:
[pair] = Counter(items).most_common(1)
item, max_count = pair

**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 So, don't forget that you can unpack tuples (or any iterable, as noted in tip 48) multiple levels deep.

I don't find myself needing this feature often, but when I do I find it VERY helpful.

This feature comes in particularly handy when looping over iterables containing tuples-of-tuples.

💬 it has MCP for agents true, but it has LSP + CLI + Web for humans. We win!

And yeah, the basic idea is that a specification is a human-readable prose description of the system you want. The code is the code, and it's very useful to have tooling to keep both in sync.
