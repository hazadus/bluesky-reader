💬 Even if you ignore everything else about this and take it purely as an understanding of adoption, it's still disturbingly supremacist. 

The idea that the adoptee *owes* the adopters is entirely backwards. Otherwise they're not adoptive parents; they're speculators on a captive human life.

💬 today's lesson:

copies are cheap
hashing is expensive

![Table displaying the results of a benchmark for hashmaps with four stages: "Before any optimization" with a time of 101 microseconds, "After string optimization" with 92.5 microseconds, "After collector pattern" with 57.8 microseconds, and the "serde_json baseline" with 88 microseconds. The column shows the performance comparison against serde_json, indicating a total improvement of 43% faster.](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:dqrcz4py2hrv4lzcs6ygoagj/bafkreidpbdfdm6ucdwpqhmwgemnh2kvucywmkun3ouacqryknukestjoie@jpeg)

💬 doesn't matter, this isn't "get the fastest hashmap", this is "have facet-format-json's tier2 JIT beat serde_json on the /same/ hashmap type".

when I need fast hashmaps I look elsewhere :)

💬 that's the idea!

nuxt is built to be extensible and that's why we have so many modules built by the community 🙌 

empowering users to change their experience based on their needs is pretty important

💬 At the https://gpg.fail talk and omg #39c3

You can just put a \0 in the Hash: header and then newlines and inject text in a cleartext message.

Won’t even blame PGP here. C is unsafe at any speed.

gpg has not fixed it yet.

💬 hi, claude successfully ported aasvg to rust so I can use it in dodeca

https://github.com/bearcove/aasvg-rs

it has zero deps and produces the exact same output enjoyyyy

(except mine has light-dark support)

💬 have /you/ seen that I silently made a second (!) facet-postcard implementation and this one uses cranelift to deserialize faster than serde? (I need to put those results up on https://perf.facet.rs too)

💬 facet reflection is already a bit fat, adding cranelift... lol. I don't mind the extra size but make your own measurements!

💬 Pretty much all the JIT stuff that's in facet I /am/ going to use, for the experience? But for most use cases, it makes more sense to either pay the cost of "interpreted" or just stay with serde which is safe+inlines like a mofo+auto-vectorized by LLVM etc.

💬 There is a third way, which would be to use facet to generate serialization and deserialization code in a build script? You would have to put your types in a separate crate that is also a build dependency. I'm doing that for codegen for rapace-{swift,typescript}, and it's working pretty well.

💬 It's crazy how emotionally charged this topic is. You would think there would be rational technical, social and ethical debates, yet it's anything but that. The tribalism and virtue signaling is throught the roof. It's looks like a disease at this point. At a time when we need sanity more than ever.
