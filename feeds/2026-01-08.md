💬 Oh it's so good! Highly recommend it just as a nice place on the internet. It has a bunch of services attached that "just work" really well.

💬 Every day of my modern life, I fantasize about two things: 

1) Living somewhere I don't have to worry about myself or anyone in my family dying to gun violence or preventable disease; and

2) Thanos snapping away literally every single person in, allied with, or supportive of this fascist regime.

💬 They're essentially the realistically defensive and fantastically offensive version of the same idea, but either way: I really don't think anyone should need to fantasize about how to prevent the society they live in from killing them.

💬 My baby has started doing this thing where she wakes everyone up screaming to be fed, but then falls into an impenetrable dead sleep the literal second a bottle actually touches her lips, and I don't know if I've ever found anything more maddeningly infuriating in my entire life.

New rule: if it's not worth consuming at 1x, it's not worth consuming at all.

💬 Python Tip #8 (of 365):

Use De Morgan's Law to make more readable Boolean expressions. 🧵

De Morgan's Law states that:

- "not (A or B)" is the same as "(not A) and (not B)"
- "not (A and B)" is the same as "(not A) or (not B)"

💬 In other words:

> You can distribute a "not" into (or out of) a Boolean expression as long as you flip "and" and "or".

This is true as long as neither of the expressions on either side rely on short-circuiting to avoid an exception (recall tip #6 on short-circuiting).

💬 A double negative is a positive, so any variation of and/or can be modified with De Morgan's law.

"not A or B" is the same as "not (A and not B)"

Since operators like ==, in, and > all have opposites, a not/negation could flip those too.

"not (x == y or x = 0"

💬 De Morgan's law is helpful for converting Boolean expressions that read awkwardly to something that reads more naturally.

For example, this:
not (not field‍.kw_only and field not in old_kw_only_fields)

Can be rewritten as:
field‍.kw_only or field in old_kw_only_fields

💬 So if your Boolean expression reads awkwardly, try negating things with De Morgan's Law and see if readability improves.

💬 There's just no way to make a list like that look good. When you're listing people and have an evidence column... you're in the witch hunting business. Doesn't matter what the original intent was.

💬 yeah so you have to run "tmux -CC" manually? and then splits/tabs/etc. are all just magically tmux panes

(if you don't run tmux -CC then tmux is just.. normal)
