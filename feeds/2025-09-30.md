💬 Using functions for sub-expressions instead of using variables can be helpful if you need to rely on short-circuiting to make sure that some of your sub-expressions will not be run in certain cases. https://trey.io/f98u5c

💬 Long but very good:

"An essay on wank"

It names and identifies one of my least favorite genre of posts – finally I have a proper term for it!

I'm sure I've been guilty of it too in the past, so it's useful for self-regulation, too.

💬 A quick call for help: many moons ago I've seen a rage-style comic on Twitter that shows the diff btw junior & senior developers (happy, listening to EDM, shipping vs old man w/ long beard, sitting in dark, next to a tower of literal shit, bleary eyes).

I can't find it anymore – any clues?

💬 We do use vercel for the main website static hosting (+ middleware) but I've been edging us off for a while and I guess I have more reasons - its expensive but solid

💬 I am interested in learning more about #passkeys (aka #passwordless). I've read a few older articles about how, due to the requirement of never allowing a "decrypted", passkeys are not portable across "providers".

💬 So if you want to move from an iPhone to Android and you have passkeys associated with your keyring there's no way to move those passkeys to your new phone, you'd be regenerating them all for every service. Is this still the case in 2025, or has progress been made on this front?

💬 Sometimes—not often, but every once in a while—you make a decision that turns out to be *so good* it feels like you keep reaping the benefits over and over for years afterwards.

Declining to interview at Vercel, after being personally recruited ~3 years ago, has become maybe my biggest example.

💬 I can't take too much credit. I admit I was genuinely flattered to be contacted by them at the time.

I just got a sense, even back then, that the vibes were off, and was lucky enough to know someone who had previous dealings with the company and could basically confirm that for me.
