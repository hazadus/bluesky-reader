💬 I'm happy to announce arborium, a collection of 96 tree-sitter grammars (so far) that compile cleanly as crates and npm packages, for desktop & wasm.

It comes with themes, two rustdoc integrations, a clean HTML+ANSI highlighter, get it while it's hot:

💬 Big fan of @fasterthanli.me’s new library wrapping tree-sitter grammars up with a really nice Rust API. Spent a bit of the afternoon replacing a Syntect-based  highlighting setup with an Arborium-based setup and much prefer it—and tree-sitter grammars are much more robust than old Textmate grammars!

Ever since Junction 2.0 I've been begging it to end but it kept finding ways to keep going. :( At the beginning I loved it, at the end I yelled expletives at it when it just wouldn't end.

...which has a "code block execution" feature (à la doctests)

💬 Alright well time to port tree-sitter proper to Rust I guess 🤷

![Alt text:
A dark-mode forum or chat screenshot showing a post by user “GuillaumeGomez” (Member, posted 18 minutes ago). The message says they reviewed the dependencies of the Rust crate “arborium” and found many dependencies. They note it appears to include bindings to the C library “tree-sitter,” and conclude this is likely a no-go because the team previously worked hard to remove C dependencies from rustdoc due to many issues, ranging from linking to debugging. A small reaction indicator with a smiling emoji and a count of 1 appears below the post.](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:dqrcz4py2hrv4lzcs6ygoagj/bafkreifrdxaqpohuigavzgi2dzgklwrldcvzi5xexeh3axbwodb2jibkua@jpeg)
