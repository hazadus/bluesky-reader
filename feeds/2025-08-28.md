💬 We're launching a GoFundMe to cover legal fees to #FreeJavaScript trademark from Oracle.

We need to raise $200k to make full use of the discovery phase in the trademark cancelation petition. This is a critical step in protecting the JavaScript name for the whole community.

gotta love when a company introduces a feature you never asked for and doubles the price on a feature you care about

cool cool cool, no action required indeed

💬 Millions of followers ≠ engagement. @theguardian.com has 1.4m followers on Threads with almost no engagement. On Bluesky, links can get 3–4x more clicks than likes.

The real question isn’t “how many followers do you have?” but “what kind of engagement do you get?”

💬 TIL a GoFundMe widget adds an *entire NextJS app* to the page.

About 5MB of JavaScript—spread across almost 40 files—just to render a few lines of text and a link.

(Yes, the widget has to make an API call to show the campaign's progress. But even given that, it's still absurdly over-engineered.)

![Comparison of a page loading before and after adding one GoFundMe widget to the page. The number of requests goes from 12 to 64; transferred data goes from around 0.5 MB to 2.1MB; resources goes from 642kb to 5.8MB; and the finish time goes from 0.18 seconds to 1.14 seconds.](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:dr7ktxokjqc2suwnook4k73h/bafkreic2cxnd5xgiazg34nwawkdn7lpwghmfw44ugzperp4kchuehmiuke@jpeg)

💬 That was a fun and oddly varied mix of questions!

We talked about the _replace method on named tuples, CBV vs FBV in Django, what Django's forms do, refactoring functions that accept tons of arguments, whether calling subprocess is acceptable, functools.partial, and other things I'm forgetting.

💬 I guess to me, "over-engineered" can mean both a job done well but excessively (like a mason who reinforces a garden retaining wall with industrial grade steel beams), *and* a job done entirely improperly (like an arborist who removes a tree using drone missiles). I meant the latter here.

💬 True, though, for the kind of code I usually write, the cost of a functional call is usually dirt cheap in the grand scheme.

Definitely worth considering whether the performance hit is non-negligible for the application though.
