💬 stupid question, I have annotations like

// r[impl foo.bar.baz]

in Rust code, but now... doing a text search for `impl` is polluted by all these.

I should rename the annotation verb to...

💬 Python Tip #7 (of 365):

Avoid using "or" short-circuiting for fallback reassignments. 🧵

Instead of this:

name = name or "world"

I recommend this:

if not name:
    name = "world"

That second approach is more verbose, but I also find it more readable at a glance.

**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 Why does this one-liner even work?

name = name or "world" 

Aren't "and" and "or" about booleans?

Well, "and" and "or" (&& and || in most languages) return the value of the last expression they evaluate.

So name is reassigned to itself whenever it's truthy and assigned to "world" otherwise.

**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 Note that my advice here is a preference that varies among programming communities.

In JavaScript, this isn't uncommon:

name = name || "world"

But in Python, it's not nearly as common.

That isn't to say you should never rely on the short-circuiting of "or", but I recommend conservative use.

💬 I do occasionally use code like:

name = u.sname or u.fname

Instead of:

if u.sname:
  name = u.sname
else:
  name = u.fname

That "if" isn't bad, but it's not more readable than the shorter version.

With short-circuiting it's more obvious that name has a preferred value and a fallback.

**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 But... how are these lines meaningfully different?

name = name or "world"
name = u.sname or u.fname 

In the first case, we're only trying to change "name" if it doesn't yet have a truthy value.

But in the second case we're not reassigning: we're freshly assigning "name" to one of 2 values.

**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 This fallback assignment approach is occasionally seen in Python, but it's not used nearly as often as in languages like JavaScript.

If you'd prefer to avoid relying on "or" short-circuiting for all truthy fallback values (not just for re-assignments), I wouldn't blame you.

**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 For this style-based tip, the preferences of you, your team, and the programming community you're within are all important factors.

If you and your team don't have a string preference, I would recommend either avoiding short-circuiting (outside of a boolean context) or using it conservatively.
