💬 I remember renting the original Lilo & Stitch on DVD, and watching it alone, in a rented bedroom, on a PlayStation 2, circa 2002...and man, if I would've had any inkling how hard my own kid would laugh that movie some 23-ish years later, I would've never returned it.

💬 been building a few TUIs lately and that one was misbehaving, and... well, a screen recording is a tool you should never underestimate (this error was present for 1 frame)

![A screenshot of a tool called E2E Runner that shows various things in progress. And at the bottom there's an exception, says the application panicked, crashed, byte index 47 is not a car boundary, it is inside some Unicode character. Various tasks being done are Docker, build packages, build bear shop, migrations, seed Medusa, build storefront, storefront playwright. ](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:dqrcz4py2hrv4lzcs6ygoagj/bafkreiflsfcakm6krdbwpwyamhsmasrio6xpxezsvnfbappo4ln3nfwqpq@jpeg)

💬 so when you use a popular node.js ecommerce framework, it's normal to have to set up a watchdog so that various node.js processes kill themselves if their parent dies instead of ballooning up to 400% CPU right? that's just node now?

💬 In the first episode you get the parodic reading scene, the bar where carol looks for help, the guy who gets back is severed leg in the bg, the official tv speaker... It is fantastic dark comedy.

I mean, certainly people realized the John Cena recording is humourous?

💬 You want to see something REALLLLLY cool ?

uvx ptn

WARNING: you might want run ptn in a sandbox, a container or a VM and not directly on your machine.

💬 This was my first read of 2026 and I highly recommend it.

This book challenges liberals, conservatives, and various other groups to introspect the true reasons behind their thinking on immigration.

Also it's a comic book, which makes it more fun to read.

💬 Python Tip #3 (of 365):

Learn about the common string formatting specifications. No need to memorize them, but learn which ones exist as it'll help you remember to look them up when you need them. 🧵

💬 F-strings allow using a `:` to specify a format specification within their replacement fields (the `{`...`}` parts).

For example, you can format a number to show as thousands separators:

>>> amount = 3280
>>> f"{amount:,}"
'3,280'

💬 Memorize the below facts...

For numbers you can:

1. Format to N decimals
2. Format as a percentage (also to N decimals)
3. Zero-pad to N characters
4. Space-pad to N characters

For strings, numbers, and some other types, you can:

1. right-pad
2. left-pad
3. center-align

💬 For integers you can also:

1. Format as binary
2. Format as hexadecimal

Other types (datetime.datetime, ipaddress.IPv4Address, various third-party objects, etc.) support other formats as well.

💬 I don't recommend memorizing the above format specs, but I do recommend memorizing which format specs exist so that you'll remember to look them up as you need them.

The exact syntax isn't as important as the ability. The syntaxes aren't very intuitive and you can look them up when you need them.

💬 I'm reading more and more about people who think they solved the authenticity problem by saying we should cryptographically sign pictures at the camera level.

If the key is in the hardware, it will be leaked and have no impact.

If not, you will empower a small group to gate content validation.

💬 A few weeks ago, I had an idea for an animal cruelty offset calculator that shows how underfunded the animal welfare space is, shows the current (huge) impact of $1 today, and encourages donations to specific charities based on lifestyle.

It turns out, this already exists! It's called FarmKind.
