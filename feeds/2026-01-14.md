💬 lol Balatro is my most-played game for the second year in a row—even though almost all of that time was in January, when I was chasing Completionist++.

Notably, 11 different games were my most-played game of that individual month in 2025. (BotW Switch 2 Edition is the only repeat.)

![My Nintendo Year in Review. My most played games in order: Balatro; Zelda: Breath of the Wild Switch 2 Edition; and Silksong.](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:dr7ktxokjqc2suwnook4k73h/bafkreieazjcq56fz7jzuqmso36nnrf4wepebcfbakt3gstedt3ooy2djz4@jpeg)

💬 Never finished Outer Wilds (got close, but it was just too much of a pain in the ass) or Lorelei and the Laser Eyes (hit a wall when puzzles got obtuse and literally couldn't figure out what to do next). Other than that, I think I finished every game on the list, with "good ending" where applicable.

💬 Oh yeah: I also don't know how many hours I actually put into Blue Prince—it's not listed here since I played it on Steam—but I have to think it probably must have been the actual #1 for at least one month. Guessing I must have started up April/May's first-person puzzle games because of Blue Prince.

💬 The skill/luck ratio is just beautiful.

I think the fact that they've made no attempt whatsoever to balance the jokers is what makes the game so compelling, though.

If it's something we wanted, and the author makes it clear that (a) they understand what the code is and (b) they chose to create it that way, (and (c) I agree with their judgement), then I'll engage.

💬 these changes are just in the nuxt ui template, which is a bit opinionated in this case.

we haven't changed the defaults in nuxt/eslint because the module itself is not opinionated, and stylistic linting is very much a decision you should make for yourself, not one nuxt will enforce on you.

💬 Did you know @vitest.dev has `expect.poll`? It reruns an assertion until it passes (or times out).
You can configure how many times the `expect.poll` callback should run with custom interval and timeout options!

No need wrapping everything in `vi.waitFor`
More in the docs https://vitest.dev/api/expect.html#poll

![Infographic titled "Vitest's expect.poll" with three bullet points: built-in timeout and retry logic, cleaner than wrapping assertions in vi.waitFor, and perfect for job queues & eventual consistency. Below is a code example showing a test that starts a background export job, then uses expect.poll to repeatedly check getJobStatus(job.id) until it equals 'completed'. VoidZero and Vitest logos at bottom corners.](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:vqbogjyhzudzajc6bu6mxdni/bafkreif4j4gelgfe57j3o7jibmxvpt4shmjomnvffnemjyhtnhjker5jre@jpeg)

💬 if I had to guess, I would say it's an issue with how npm installs native bindings.

as to why it's happening on Vercel and not locally, you may need to enable corepack, but check your deploy logs to see if you can get any more information ....

💬 Python Tip #14 (of 365):

Use negative indexes.

Instead of this:
last = items[len(items)-1]

Do this:
last = items[-1]

If you're moving from a language that doesn't have negative indexes, it's easy to forget about them.

That's the whole tip! It's a short one today.

So for 2025 they used my 2023 income from when I worked for some american company.
And for 2026 they used my 2024 reported income which was zero because, well.. two weeks' worth of work.
