💬 I didn't think of it this way at the time, but I now realize that in more capable hands, this game probably could've leaned into the camp pretty successfully with not a lot of adjustments, instead of always being either way too serious or way too laughable.

💬 I avoided reviews until I was finished and I'm genuinely shocked to see the game getting such good scores.

I theorize it's just because of the Metroid name, honestly. It feels a lot like when Skyward Sword was getting all 10s, and a few years later everyone admitted it was actually really bad.

💬 To me it just...wasn't a Metroid game?

Metroid games have an entire genre half named after them, with isolation and interconnected worlds you backtrack through as key features.

This was like, Wind Waker hub world, but in a desert and on a motorcycle, plus...idk, YA sci-fi?

💬 I can hear the existential, ethical, societal, and economic arguments against AI.

However, if Linus Torvald and Salvatore Sanfilippo can use AI productively, I can't take seriously people arguing against its usefulness.

💬 Instead of checking for True and False with equality:

if flag == True:
    ...

We prefer to check for True and False with identity:

if flag is True:
    ...

This is for the same reason that we prefer to check for None with identity (PEP 8 recommends it).

But instead of True/False checks...

💬 We usually prefer to rely on truthiness instead...

So instead of this:

if flag is True:
    ...

Do this:

if flag:
    ...

Instead of checking for True, False, and non-boolean values (to raise an exception), using truthiness allows others to provide non-boolean values as truthiness indicators.

💬 Plenty of stuff can be hidden in a study that requires a lot of work on readers' side to unveil. Much harder for 2 big open source contributors with 20 years of great work history in git and impact on the world to be distrusted.

💬 I've seen multiple "there's about to be an explosion of new software thanks to AI" takes lately. Seems to be in the water, I guess.

For my part: I'm skeptical, both that it will happen, and that it would actually be a good thing if it did.

💬 My main question is: if it's gonna happen, why hasn't it already happened? Nothing is really that different now than it was six months or a year ago. Why now? What's changed?

Sure, LLMs have improved, but surely we'd at least see an uptick already; the foothills of the peak. But we don't. Why not?

💬 And regardless, if it did happen: wouldn't that just be an overwhelming tidal wave of minimal-effort apps?

If it's so easy that everyone's doing it, and apps are by 10x-ing or 100x-ing, where's the value in any of them? Why does any of it matter if it's all so trivially replaceable?

💬 Every time I browse Steam or the Nintendo eShop, I see like 100 meaningless, cheaply-produced games for every decent title I'm actually interested in.

App stores are already kind of this way; why is doubling or tripling or 10xing the sheer *number* of apps a positive thing?

Isn't that *worse*?

💬 I can see myself being wrong on the second point. If software were truly democratized and trivial for anyone to create, maybe that's a net good.

But I just don't think it's happening. I think a handful of tech people are imagining what *they'd* do with extra productivity, and projecting.

💬 I don't think AI means everyone's gonna be making a ton of apps any more than Squarespace meant everyone was making a ton of websites.

*Some* people made more, sure. 

*Some* people who couldn't or wouldn't have before did, absolutely.

But the general populace did not turn into website makers.

💬 I just don't think AI is going to turn everyone into software makers. 

I'm sure some new people will try it. And I'm sure some current software makers will make a lot more now. 

But in general, I think most people would prefer not to even go to *that* much trouble.
