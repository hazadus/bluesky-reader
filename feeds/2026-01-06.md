💬 "[Refusing ICE/DHS] is not reflective of Hilton values" 😡 Apparently Hilton corporate values include more racially motivated kidnapping of neighbors.

💬 Python Tip #6 (of 365):

Use short-circuiting to collapse nested "if" statements. 🧵

These nested "if" statements:

if result:
    if result.success:
        print("success!")

Can instead be written with a single "if":

if result and result.success:
    print("success!")

💬 Due to short-circuiting, the expression "result.success" will only be evaluated if the expression "result" is evaluated as truthy.

So if "result" is None, "result.success" will never be evaluated. That's good because that avoids an exception from trying to access a "success" attribute of None.

💬 This means that swapping the order of conditions around an "and" or an "or" in Python doesn't always work.

This is fine:

if result and result.success:
    print("success!")

But this would be a problem (assuming "result" may be None):

if result.success and result:
    print("success!")

💬 So Python's "and" and  "or" operators won't evaluate their right-hand expression unless they need to.

This fact is called "short-circuiting".

And you can sometimes use the fact that "and" and "or" short-circuit to collapse nested conditions.

But don't overdo it!

**🕒 17:21 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 I don't recommend this:

name = name or "world"

Instead I'd recommend:

if not name:
    name = "world"

That "if" focuses on the fact that we're changing "name" only if it's falsey, but the assignment with "or" doesn't make that clear.

I'll talk more about that "or" expression in tomorrow's tip.

💬 a measured response on Greenland from a number of NATO members

I’m reluctant to give much attention to what I can only imagine is an incendiary misdirection from matters closer to home but 🤷‍♂️

![6 January 2026

Joint Statement on Greenland

Statement by President Macron of France, Chancellor Merz of Germany, Prime Minister Meloni of Italy, Prime Minister Tusk of Poland, Prime Minister Sánchez of Spain, Prime Minister Starmer of the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Frederiksen of Denmark on Greenland.

Arctic security remains a key priority for Europe and it is critical for international and transatlantic security.

NATO has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European Allies are stepping up. We and many other Allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries. The Kingdom of Denmark - including Greenland - is part of NATO.

Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.

The United States is an essential partner in this endeavour, as a NATO ally and through the defence agreement between the Kingdom of Denmark and the United States of 1951.

Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:jbeaa5kdaladzwq3r7f5xgwe/bafkreia3mhv5lyzau24lzfbo3vmrik45dlr7ug4ervmwcezlwu7ir5zfyq@jpeg)
