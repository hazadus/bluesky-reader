💬 You could also try out using De Morgan's Law to see if distributing or un-distributing a negation might make your expression a little bit easier to read.

💬 Have you ever wondered whether Huey, Dewey, and Louie have two uncles and no apparent father because Scrooge and Donald rescued them from their brother, an evil scientist who created the boys in his laboratory?

💬 Oh absolutely. Like your comment notes, it’s running an actual parser vs a bunch of regular expressions.

I’ve done zero profiling though, there might be performance left on the table!

💬 "Wonderful Christmastime" gets all the hate, but I think there's a strong argument to be made that "Happy Xmas (War is Over)" is actually the worse Beatles Christmas song.

💬 Not that it's strictly your call, but the thing I'm most interested in seeing/playing is a turbo-like build which handles many different vite projects - which I assume is what vite+ and so I'm looking forwards to 2026

💬 Look I'm not defending Wonderful Christmastime; I'm just saying it seems like it knows it's supposed to be a fun silly song, whereas Happy Xmas sounds like it was written by a 4th grader who takes himself way too seriously and used the first match out of the rhyming dictionary for every other line.

💬 "Let's hope it's a good one without any fear" is an utterly indefensible line for a chorus. No human talks like that. No human has EVER talked like that. If that song was written today, you'd swear it was AI slop. It's obviously just a shoehorned rhyme so bad it makes Coldplay look poetic.

💬 Are there terrible lyrics in Wonderful Christmastime? Inarguably. But it's a dumb song that knows it's a dumb song. Happy Xmas is a dumb song that thinks it's an important, poignant song, and I say that makes it worse.

💬 Introducing Flint: a fast, friendly linter.
