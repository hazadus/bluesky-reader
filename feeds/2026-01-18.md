💬 [Warning: rare NFL skeet] 

Even as a basically lifelong Broncos fan, I feel bad for the Bills after this one

💬 This, but also: literally anything anyone made.

Books, songs, plays, blog posts, websites, games, clothes, crafts, food—genuinely anything a human created.

I promise you they did it, to some degree, just because they wanted to hear somebody say something nice about it.

💬 I streamed with @daliashea.bsky.social about the state of AI in development, and what it's actually good for. We both use AI *and* are skeptics, which made for good conversation!

fuck you—how about instead of making your sweng applicants balance a red-black tree on a whiteboard you make sure they know about trimming whitespace

💬 today's design problem:
if we let third-party binaries supply schemas, that means we need to exec them to dump their schema which is a security issue, so we need to design a consent flow... => NO WE DON'T we can just SCAN THE BINARY for a marker and exfiltrate the schemas without risking anything 😎

💬 Python Tip #18 (of 365):

Merge iterables using asterisks, like this: "[*first, *second]" 🧵

To merge two iterables, first and second, into third don't do this:

third = list(first) + list(second)

Do this:

third = [*first, *second]

Why?...

💬 Is it just me or is the name "Gavin" an absolute disqualifying turnoff all on its own? 

Gavin sounds like a kid who goes skiing in Europe on spring break. 

Gavin gives "I'm a stalker and I write poetry about it"

Gavin has "his parents sued to get him a spot on the polo team" vibes.

💬 Finding this very interesting: https://bsky.app/profile/danabra.mov/post/3mcoktonamk2m

Makes me wonder if we can make a Puzzmo's daily puzzles as something we put on @puzzmo.com Bluesky's registry.  Then for folks who opt in, place their puzzle progress/results in their user's registry on puzzle completions.

💬 Tricky because aside from the Crossword, all our puzzle definition formats are unique to the puzzle (but we are standardising a bit) but progress state and stats is fully one-off

Still an interesting thing to explore

💬 Two reasons:

1. It's faster (no need to make two lists and then concatenate to get a third)
2. "There's a special syntax for that" usually indicates that it's more idiomatic as well

Remember my recommendation AGAINST using [*old] to copy a list (tip 13)?

"*" isn't for copying so much as merging

💬 Love it! 

One tiny suggestion: it might be worth looking into preloading the images. As-is, when I open a drawer, there's a moment of broken placeholder before the image loads in.

Though that said, maybe that's a worthwhile tradeoff to save bandwidth.
