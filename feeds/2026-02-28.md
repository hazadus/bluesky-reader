💬 If future historians uncover nothing else from our time, I want them to know for certain the term "doomscrolling" was overwhelmingly used both during and directly because of Trump administrations.

We might never have even invented, let alone popularized the term, if it wasn't for that sack of shit.

💬 Still waiting for an Yle investigation to reveal that the media and government have exploited Finland's image as the "happiest country in the world" to sell an inaccurate or downright misleading image of life in the country.

💬 Feels like one more weekend before I say 'it's ready' and start having claims claimed not be marked as "pre-release". 

Needs a design pass for logos, branding etc but lexicons and implementation strategy are basically solid

💬 Python Tip #59 (of 365):

Don't use comprehensions to loop 🧵

List comprehensions are for creating new lists, not for looping.

This is a valid comprehension:

[print(n**2) for n in numbers]

But it's also a misuse of the comprehension syntax.

💬 That comprehension DOES print numbers but it also returns a new list:

>>> [print(n**2) for n in numbers]
4
1
9
16
49
[None, None, None, None, None]

It's a list of None values because the print function returns None (since it DOES a thing instead of RETURNING a thing).

💬 The purpose of a comprehension is to return a new list. And a comprehension will ALWAYS create a new list.

If your goal isn't to create a new list, don't use a list comprehension. If your goal is to loop, use a "for" loop.

💬 @fasterthanli.me is absolutely *cooking* with Tracey. I couldn't be more excited. Using this for a prototype IDL project for postcard, but it's so good I'd like to replace postcard's spec with one written in tracey (or really: just add annotations to the existing markdown+rs!)

💬 Oh, I forgot to mention: it has an LSP, and it even works with SublimeText. You can over over annotations and jump to spec/impl/verification!

This is *crazy* good!

💬 Does anybody else spend a lot of time thinking about where the point of moral and ethical permissibility is on indiscriminately murdering billionaires, and how there are a whole lot of perfectly valid and well-reasoned arguments to be made that we're already past that line?

...Or is that just me?
