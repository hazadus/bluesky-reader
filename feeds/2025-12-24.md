💬 +1 for classes. It creates a little extra boilerplate at times, but it's the most with-the-grain option in my experience

💬 vertical integration is bad when apple does it but great when I (build system → query system → RPC system → CAS → serialization system → reflection ecosystem / data model) do it.

💬 this year has been a long series of discussions that went:
"let's do Z!"
"ah no that'd be crazy hard.. unless you already had Y working"
"can we make Y?"
"Y is super tricky to get right unless you base in on something like X" 
"guess what we're making now"

💬 I'm currently going through the whole "Apple Developer → Identifiers → Certificates → Provisioning Profiles → Code signing → Why doesn't it show up in System Extensions → Missing an entitlement" dance, and in French we say that it's about as pleasant as se coincer les couilles dans une porte.

💬 I'd argue it's worse than a blank page, in the same way that garment pieces cut slightly off the grain are worse than not having cut yet.

When a thing is wrong, it will suck your energy into making it Less Wrong, which is often not the same as making it right.

💬 Love how every time there's an influx of new users, Bluesky turns into one of those video games with an un-skippable tutorial, only it's all the players giving it to each other

💬 I've got to imagine that to a user who joined Bluesky during a spike, it must just look like a platform of endless infantilizing tutorials on how to use the platform of endless infantilizing tutorials
