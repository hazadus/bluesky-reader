💬 "Say nothing" is OP.

It's a free action, it rarely makes things worse, and it has a high chance of helping you avoid regrets.

Best of all, you can always change your mind later.

💬 Great post about generative AI. Happy Holidays. Don't say I never gave you anything. https://anthonymoser.github.io/writing/ai/haterdom/2025/08/26/i-am-an-ai-hater.html

![I do understand: you want permission. There’s a machine in the corner wrapped in human skin that makes things out of shit and blood to look like whatever you want (as long as you don’t look too closely). You gave one to your teacher and they didn’t notice. Your boss told you to use it after they laid off half the team and it was fine. You fed one to your kids and they liked it. You want to know you can use it sometimes without me thinking less of you. You don’t need me to believe it’s useful, you just want me to be polite about it.](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:jvhw6v6rt4motcndq4gh5qo7/bafkreifuvccetago6z7awyhw5hym3p7cqzajkj3m3pylfq5264hij6oe7i@jpeg)

💬 It strikes me that conservatives trying to make Erika Kirk/Katie Miller happen is just the mirror image of Dems trying to "move to the middle" on e.g. trans rights.

Both are doomed; neither base will ever be remotely interested in a watered-down middle.

But it's telling that they're trying.

💬 Had an 'upgrade to vite 8' PR running for a few weeks, and got it feature complete. Here's the rough difference in build timings for our vite projects in a monorepo from 6 -> 8.

Looking like the react compiler is now ~90% of the build times for https://puzzle.com

https://github.com/bearcove/tracey

![A screenshot of the traceability matrix as produced by the TRACE tool with 41 total rules, 97.6% implementation coverage and 46.3% test coverage. There's a bunch of rules that have an identifier.

Implementation references have a little code icon. is also off screen we don't really see them, there's test references and everything 

Everything is nicely structured and everything. It's using public sands and IBM Plex Mono. It's very tasteful if I say so myself. ](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:dqrcz4py2hrv4lzcs6ygoagj/bafkreiaz7ig2b5vwxdhsvdal2caczxgohk2jljyi5qhmnqldxsihit73ti@jpeg)

💬 Full builds are generally rare, incremental builds happen all the time. I'd take being able to not think about a lot of things (which is kinda the goal of the compiler) in favour of occasionally slower builds

I'm looking forward to the speed up in a big (and slow) site, like FastAPI.

For now, I'm keeping the same old theme to ensure it all works. Later, I'll try the modern one.
