💬 It's always struck me how little empirical evidence there is that AI actually saves time, given how widely accepted the idea seems to be. 

No company has more motivation to prove it than Anthropic—yet their own study confirms the speed gain is not only insignificant, but carries *steep* penalties.

💬 what I love most about open source is the community 😊

... and I think that's what makes nuxt and vite so special to everyone involved ❤️

I'm glad @patak.dev is willing to join me as a steward of npmx 🙏

![danielroe — Yesterday at 20:41

hello everyone! 👋

... and apologies for the ping, but now seems a good time to talk about what npmx is as an open source project.

it was 8 days ago that I made the first commit, and I had something I was excited about a day later. it was clear to me from [the](https://bsky.app/profile/danielroe.dev/post/3md3cmrg56k2r) [community](https://bsky.app/profile/danielroe.dev/post/3md47mg7qjs22) that it would be big, and I invited patak to join two days later.

it's impossible to believe that it's been less than a week since we started inviting close allies and trusted folk. we're already at 75+ npmx contributors, and around 200 people on the server now, which is an outstanding percentage.

so now seems like a good time to make explicit what 'npmx' is:
we're open-source and for the good of the web
we're a community project, built by all of us

it might be a bit early for it, but patak and I have drafted a governance doc to set out a bit about how we want to steward npmx. it's short but we'll be filling it out more as we go on.

we've also created an opencollective so we can help support the community and hopefully, one day, help other similar projects.

we want to make the experience of using npmjs better for us and for others. and the joy of open source is that we can do that together! I hope it goes without saying, but thank you ❤️

we'd love your thoughts on the document and on the project 🙏](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:jbeaa5kdaladzwq3r7f5xgwe/bafkreie5llrqiqez75hvyang2j62bvd4fbip4fmzb5jkltoiygplhlzjea@jpeg)

💬 I still think that's quite the indictment, for two reasons: 

1. I don't think that's how most people use AI; and

2. In other words: this demonstrates that as long as you take the time to use AI with care and discipline, it offers no significant benefit over not using AI at all.

💬 The only such study I could find linked from this one was pretty limited; it only compared time to complete specific tasks, rather than net productivity, and did so—by its own admission—without measuring for any potential tradeoff that might lower the net score (such as the AI doing a worse job).

**🕒 12:55 👤 @collinsworth.dev (Josh Collinsworth)**
💬 Yes, many studies show AI can get various *tasks* done faster, but I think it's dangerous to conflate that with the idea that AI offers a net overall productivity boost. You'd need to measure much more than just speed to make that assertion (quality, for example), and these studies generally do not.

💬 Very often when trying to think about a problem I start wondering:

"How does software X deal with that?"

And 98.5% the answer is: they don't, they just let it fail. Often silently. Every time I keep relearning how low the standards usually are in this industry.

💬 "Anecdotal" is the operative word there. How do you know AI is actually making you faster, and not just making you *feel* like you're getting things done faster, if there's no measurement? How can you be sure the benefit in one area is not offset by unnoticed costs in others?

**🕒 14:41 👤 @collinsworth.dev (Josh Collinsworth)**
💬 That's my original point; from what I can tell, there's little to no empirical research on *net* AI impact, let alone that supports the idea of AI as a net gain. The overwhelming majority seems either anecdotal, or scoped much more narrowly, without examination of any metric besides speed.

**🕒 15:22 👤 @collinsworth.dev (Josh Collinsworth)**
💬 I never said it was useless; I'm just summarizing the study:

- The speed boost is statistically insignificant;

- It comes with a major downside in skill reduction;

- If you use AI mindfully, you can offset the downside. 

So in this context, best-case, it offers no benefit, at no cost.

💬 Python Tip #31 (of 365):

If you need to preserve the original line endings when reading or writing a file, use newline="" when opening your file. 🧵

💬 For historical reasons, different operating systems use different conventions for line endings in text files:

- Very old Mac machines used a carriage return character (\r)
- Windows uses a carriage return followed by a line feed (\r\n)
- Linux and Mac use a line feed character (\n)

**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 Python does some special things when reading and writing files in an attempt to handle all of these conventions sensibly.

In Python:
•  When writing a file on Windows, "\n" is converted to "\r\n".
•  When reading a file on ANY OS, "\r\n" (and lone "\r" characters) are converted to "\n".

💬 Python's "turn it all into line feeds when reading" convention makes the lives of Python programmers easier.

The "write \r\n on Windows" is a conservative precaution.

These defaults are usually pretty useful... unless you need to preserve the original line endings in a file.

💬 If you need the original line endings, you COULD open the file in binary mode to get the raw bytes, but that's WAY more hassle than it's worth.

Instead, when calling open, set the "newline" keyword argument to an empty string:

file = open(filename, newline="")

💬 If you pass newline="" when reading a file, the text you read will contain the original line endings, be they "\r\n", "\n", or even "\r".

If you pass newline="" when writing a file on Windows, "\n" characters will not be automatically converted to "\r\n".

💬 newline="" is handy for:
1. Writing CSVs: csv.writer writes "\r\n" so without newline="" you'll get "\r\r\n" on Windows
2. Ensuring file processing that reads and then overwrites the file doesn't change line endings
3. Whenever exact text matters: checking for mixed line endings, diffing tools, etc.

**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 Stick with the default line ending normalization that Python does in most cases.

But when you need to make sure not to double convert \n into \r\n or when you need to the exact file contents, use newline=""

💬 I haven’t read the paper, but I have no doubt AI assistance worsens coding skills — just like 3GL languages worsened assembly skills.

But software engineering is not about coding, it’s about solving problems with software. Code has just been the means to this for so long we cannot disentangle them.
