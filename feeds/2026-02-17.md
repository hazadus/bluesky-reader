💬 was trying to figure out why the fuck they're offering a french class about EVE Online and stared at this and the class description for like 5 minutes before I realized it's an online class in the evening

💬 A different article than usual, focused on a new hosting service that recently came out:

ssh https://exe.dev

https://www.bitecode.dev/p/exedev-a-new-hosting-solution-for

TL;DR: the value is far away from OVH or Hetzner, but so it’s damn convenient and frankly, super fun.

And I’m not saying that because we share the same .tld

💬 This cycle plays every 10 years. Before it was no-code. Before that it was outsource code. Before that it was generate code from UML...

Every single time, after 2-5 years, the projects died with catastrophic money and reputation loss.

Then I get called to fix it and double my prices.

Love it.

💬 Don't get me wrong, AI is very productive and useful. It is revolutionizing our work. 

It is changing everything.

And it is also giving a lot of false confidence to people that will dig themselves into a hole, and then ask for help to get out.

Two things can be true.

This is good for business.

💬 Not great for the customers of those companies, of course, but it's a human trait: we never learn our lessons unless we feel the pain. Theory doens't cut it, we need to pay some real life prie.

"This time it's different" and "My situation is not the same" are the most famous last words.

💬 There is actually a difference this time though: some people will destroy competition because they will use AI correctly.

Unlike no-code/outsourcing/uml, this is not just a trend, it's an industrial revolution scale change.

But boy, we will see the bodies on the side of the road for the others.

💬 Dear past me, 

I know you've got a lot going on, but next time, when you just put "doctor's appointment" on the shared calendar,  maybe clarify which doctor, or even which member of the family you're talking about.

💬 If you haven't looked at Deno Deploy in a while, I genuinely think you'll be impressed with how powerful the platform has become.

I was part of the ground-up rebuild, and even I'm blown away by how many features our small-but-mighty team has been able to pack into this platform for our users. 💪

💬 It's been nice to see people using https://library.wizardzines.com/ to view their zine collections (over a thousand people have used it so far!)

I think we're going to add a feature to merge accounts if you used more than one email to buy zines

💬 Python Tip #48 (of 365):

Tuple unpacking isn't actually for tuples. 🧵

Tuple unpacking works for ANY iterable!

Here we're unpacking a list (returned by the string split method):
>>> time = "05:30"
>>> time.split(":")
['05', '30']
>>> hours, minutes = time.split(":")

💬 Using tuple unpacking with a list (or any other iterable) works:
>>> hours
'05'
>>> minutes
'30'

Tuple unpacking isn't just for tuples.

In fact, you'll sometimes hear "tuple unpacking" called iterable unpacking or multiple assignment.

But both of those names are unfortunately ambiguous.

**🕒 19:04 👤 @trey.io (Trey Hunner)**
💬 This * syntax is ALSO sometimes called "iterable unpacking":
>>> ["00", *time]
['00', '05', '30']

And assigning multiple names to one value is sometimes called "multiple assignment":
>>> hours = minutes = 0

So I usually the phrase "tuple unpacking", even though this feature isn't just for tuples.

💬 human scale software engineering is so fun but also it's harder in some ways because everything has to sorta be _more_ resilient to me not paying attention to the thing, you can do more complicated stuff when there's a team of people on call

💬 Did you know about the `/*@__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__*/` annotation?

It tells bundlers that a function has no side effects so every call to it can be tree-shaken if the result is unused.

Most bundlers and minifiers support it today. 
But there's a nuance most people miss 👇
